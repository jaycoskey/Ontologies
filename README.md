## Ontologies

**Note:** This is for personal interest only. It is not meant to be practical.

### First ontology area to experiment with: Crime
* **Examples:** Accounting fraud, money laundering, murder, terrorism
* **Why crime?** Because it is a rich domain, touching on the vast panorama of human activity, and requiring the discovery of complex information hidden by others. (This is especially true for terrorism.) This makes it a challenging area of ontological modeling.
* Due to the richness of the domain, a balance must be found between exhaustive detail and usability.
  * Initially thinking of targeting a count of 1000 non-base nouns, predicates, and properties.
* Where possible, reference existing basic ontologies (e.g., rdf, bfo, dc, foaf, owl, etc.)
* Enumerated activities can be supplemented with string properties to represent miscellaneous additional data.
* While there might not be a public dataset ready to dump into a terrorist ontology, there are plenty of detailed reports on some terrorist events, such as 2001-09-11 in New York, and 2005-07-07 in London.
* For initial proof-of-concept testing, mock data could be used, though it might not faithfully represent actual terrorist activities.
